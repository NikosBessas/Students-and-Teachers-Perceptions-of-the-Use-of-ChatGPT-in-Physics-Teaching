Students' and Teachers' Perceptions of the Use of ChatGPT in Physics Teaching

This dataset was collected from a research study conducted during the 2024-25 academic year in a junior high school in Athens, Greece. The study aimed to explore the use of ChatGPT by teachers and students in the context of Physics education. Two distinct questionnaires were designed and distributed—one for teachers and one for students—with the responses analyzed using SPSS v.26 for statistical processing.

The teacher questionnaire gathered responses from 7 teachers, while the student questionnaire gathered responses from 84 students. Both questionnaires focused on the participants' familiarity with ChatGPT, the frequency of its use, their perceptions of its utility in learning and teaching Physics, and its potential role in future educational practices.

Coding Scheme

Teacher Questionnaire:

Questions 1, 3, 10, 11, and 12 had “No” or “Yes” answers, which were coded as 0 and 1, respectively.

In Question 2, the answers were coded as follows:

“Colleagues” = 1
“Online forums” = 2
“Training workshops” = 3
“Other” = 4

The same coding scheme was used for Question 4, with:

1 = “Rarely”
2 = “Occasionally”
3 = “Frequently”
4 = “Very frequently”

For Question 9, the answers were coded as:

“Inaccurate or misleading responses” = 1
“Difficulty in integrating into lesson plans” = 2
“Lack of technical support” = 3
“Privacy concerns” = 4

Questions 5 to 8 used a 5-point Likert scale, where:

1 = “Strongly disagree”
2 = “Disagree”
3 = “Neutral”
4 = “Agree”
5 = “Strongly agree”

Student Questionnaire:

A similar coding scheme was applied to the student responses for consistent data analysis.
This coding structure was used to ensure clarity and uniformity in data analysis, making it easier to identify patterns and interpret the results from both questionnaires.
